## Branch Strategy

Following Hermes patterns with STRICT ENFORCEMENT:

```
main
├── sprint/sprint-01 (✅ PU-3, PU-4, PU-5 merged)
│   ├── feature/PU-3-docker-compose-setup (✅ Completed → Merged)
│   ├── feature/PU-4-firebase-emulator-config (✅ Completed → Merged)  
│   ├── feature/PU-5-env-config-scripts (✅ Completed → Merged)
│   └── feature/PU-6-git-hooks-ci-foundation (🚧 In Progress, rebased from sprint)
├── sprint/sprint-02 (⏸️ Pending)
├── sprint/sprint-03 (⏸️ Pending)
└── sprint/sprint-04 (⏸️ Pending)
```

**Current State**: All completed features properly merged to sprint branch. PU-6 rebased from sprint/sprint-01 instead of main. Branch strategy fixed and documented.
