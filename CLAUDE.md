## Development Commands

After running `source activate`:

- `up` - Start all services
- `down` - Stop all services
- `logs` - View logs
- `test` - Run tests
- `build` - Build for production
- `deploy` - Deploy to Firebase

## Important Guidelines

### 1. Close Out Ticket Process

**Key Phrase**: "close out ticket"

**CRITICAL**: When user says "close out ticket", execute this COMPLETE workflow automatically without stopping:

1. **Update Documentation & Memory**
   - Update relevant MEMORY.md files with new patterns/learnings
   - Update any documentation files affected by the work

2. **Commit & Push**
   - Create comprehensive commit with proper message format
   - Include ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code footer
   - Push to current feature branch

3. **Merge to Sprint Branch** (MANDATORY)
   - Switch to current sprint branch (e.g., `sprint/sprint-01`)
   - Merge feature branch to sprint branch with `--no-ff` flag
   - Clean up merged feature branch after successful merge

4. **Update Jira Ticket**
   - Add detailed completion comment with what was accomplished
   - Include key deliverables and verification steps

5. **Transition Tickets**
   - Move current ticket from In Progress â†’ Done
   - Move next ticket from Pending â†’ In Progress

6. **Create New Branch** (FROM SPRINT BRANCH)
   - CRITICAL: Create new feature branch FROM current sprint branch, NOT main
   - Use format: `feature/PU-X-ticket-name`
   - Always branch from `sprint/sprint-XX` to maintain sprint lineage

7. **Update Roadmap**
   - Update progress percentages
   - Mark current task as completed
   - Update "Current Focus" section with next task
   - Add completion notes

8. **Clear Todos**
   - Clear completed todo list items

**IMPORTANT**: Run this entire process to completion automatically. Do NOT stop and ask for confirmation between steps.

### 2. Use GitHub CLI (gh) Commands

- **IMPORTANT**: Use `gh` commands instead of GitHub App integration
- `gh pr create` - Create pull requests from feature branches
- `gh issue list` - View Jira-linked GitHub issues
- `gh repo view` - Check repository status and deployments
- `gh workflow run` - Trigger CI/CD workflows manually

### 3. Use Atlassian MCP for Jira Management

- **PROJECT**: Project Uriel (PU) tickets in Jira
- Use `mcp__atlassian__*` functions for ticket updates
- Update ticket status when starting/completing work
- Link GitHub PRs to Jira tickets in commit messages
- Follow PU-XXX ticket numbering (e.g., PU-3, PU-7)

### 4. Always Use Context7 for Best Practices

- **CRITICAL**: Reference context7 for the latest Firebase and React best practices
- Check context7 for security patterns, performance optimizations, and architectural decisions
- Use context7 examples for Firebase emulator configurations and Docker setups

### 5. Code Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Write tests for all new features

### 6. Firebase Patterns

- Use Firestore security rules for all data access
- Implement proper indexes for queries
- Use Cloud Functions for server-side logic
- Follow Firebase naming conventions

#### Security Rules Architecture

- Use helper functions for common auth checks (`isAuthenticated()`, `isAdmin()`, `isOwner()`)
- Implement RBAC with admin/user/public permission levels
- Collection-specific rules for portfolio data (projects, blog, experience, messages)
- Defensive security with explicit denials

#### Firestore Indexes Strategy

- Composite indexes for sorting + filtering combinations
- Array-contains indexes for tags/technologies
- Collection group indexes for subcollections
- Field overrides for array fields

#### Cloud Functions Structure

- TypeScript-first with strict type checking
- Modular function organization (contact, blog, analytics)
- Proper error handling with HttpsError
- SendGrid integration for email functionality

### 7. Performance Requirements

- Lighthouse score must be >95
- Time to Interactive <3s
- Implement code splitting
- Use lazy loading for images
- Cache Firebase queries appropriately

### 8. Security First

- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Validate all user inputs
- Use Firebase security rules extensively
- Implement rate limiting on Cloud Functions
- Follow OWASP best practices

## Branch Strategy (STRICT ENFORCEMENT)

**CRITICAL**: Follow this branch strategy exactly. No exceptions.

### Branch Types
- `main` - Production-ready code, deployed to production
- `sprint/sprint-XX` - Sprint integration branches (e.g., `sprint/sprint-01`)
- `feature/PU-X-description` - Feature branches for individual tickets
- `fix/PU-X-description` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/description` - Emergency production fixes

### Workflow (MANDATORY)
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch FROM sprint branch
git checkout sprint/sprint-01
git pull origin sprint/sprint-01
git checkout -b feature/PU-X-description

# 2. Work on feature, commit changes
# ... development work ...

# 3. MANDATORY: Merge to sprint branch (not main!)
git checkout sprint/sprint-01
git merge --no-ff feature/PU-X-description
git push origin sprint/sprint-01

# 4. Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feature/PU-X-description
git push origin --delete feature/PU-X-description

# 5. Create next feature branch FROM updated sprint branch
git checkout -b feature/PU-Y-next-ticket
```

### Sprint Lifecycle
- **Sprint Start**: Create `sprint/sprint-XX` from `main`
- **During Sprint**: All features merge to sprint branch
- **Sprint End**: Merge `sprint/sprint-XX` to `main`, tag release
- **Production**: Deploy from `main` branch only

### Branch Protection Rules
- `main`: Requires PR, requires status checks, no direct pushes
- `sprint/sprint-XX`: Requires feature branch merges, no direct commits
- Feature branches: Must pass all tests before merge

### Emergency Hotfixes
```bash
# Hotfix workflow (production emergencies only)
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix
# ... fix ...
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/critical-fix
git checkout sprint/sprint-01
git merge --no-ff hotfix/critical-fix  # Also merge to current sprint
```

## Testing Requirements

- Unit test coverage >80%
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Firebase rules tests mandatory
- Performance tests for key pages

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Update MEMORY.md if adding new patterns
3. Write tests first (TDD approach)
4. Implement feature
5. Run `test` to verify
6. Create PR to develop

### Updating Firebase Rules

1. Edit rules in `services/backend/firestore/firestore.rules`
2. Test locally with emulators
3. Run Firebase rules tests
4. Deploy to staging first

### Performance Optimization

1. Run Lighthouse audit
2. Check bundle size with `build --analyze`
3. Implement suggested optimizations
4. Verify improvements locally
5. Deploy to staging for real-world testing

## Memory Files Structure

The project uses MEMORY.md files in each major directory to provide context-specific guidance:

### Service-Specific Memory Files

- **[Frontend MEMORY](services/frontend/webapp/MEMORY.md)** - React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS patterns and best practices
- **[Backend MEMORY](services/backend/MEMORY.md)** - Firebase Functions, Firestore, security rules, and Cloud Functions patterns
- **[Infrastructure MEMORY](infra/MEMORY.md)** - Docker setup, deployment strategies, CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- **[Scripts MEMORY](scripts/MEMORY.md)** - Developer commands and productivity tools (IMPORTANT: Always use these!)
- **[Tests MEMORY](tests/MEMORY.md)** - Testing strategy, patterns, and deployment verification (CRITICAL: Use test commands!)

### Key Information from Memory Files

rebuild:docker

# Nuclear option (fixed)
nuke  # Type "nuke everything" to confirm

# Test emulators
curl http://localhost:4000  # UI
curl http://localhost:8080  # Firestore
```

#### Testing Strategy (Comprehensive)
