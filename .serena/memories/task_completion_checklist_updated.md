- [ ] Message status management
- [ ] Admin notification preferences

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing ‚è≥

### 4.1 Firebase MCP Integration ‚úÖ

- [x] Authentication flow validation
- [x] Function testing (local environment)
- [ ] Load testing for Firestore operations
- [ ] Function deployment testing

### 4.3 Deployment Preparation üöß
- [x] Production environment configuration
- [x] Security rules deployed
- [x] Firestore indexes deployed
- [ ] **PENDING**: Function deployment (permissions issue)
- [ ] Environment variable setup for functions
- [ ] SSL certificate configuration
- [ ] Custom domain setup

## Phase 5: Frontend Connection ‚è≥

### 5.1 React Setup ‚è≥
- [ ] Vite + React + TypeScript initialization
- [ ] Firebase client SDK configuration
- [ ] Authentication context setup
- [ ] Route protection implementation

### 5.2 Data Layer Integration ‚è≥
- [ ] Custom hooks for Firestore operations
- [ ] Real-time listeners for admin dashboard
- [ ] Offline support with Firebase caching
- [ ] Error boundary implementation

## üö® Current Blockers

### Cloud Functions Build Permissions Issue
**Status**: Blocked - Build service account missing permissions

**Solution Options**:
1. **Wait & Retry**: Permissions sometimes propagate (10-15 min)
2. **Manual IAM Fix**: Add Cloud Build roles to service account
3. **Alternative**: Use Firebase Extensions or client-side solutions

**Next Steps**:
```bash
# Option 1: Wait and retry
firebase deploy --only functions

# Option 2: Add these roles to build service account:
# - Cloud Build Service Account  
# - Artifact Registry Writer
# - Cloud Functions Developer
```

## üéØ Implementation Priorities

### Critical Path (Must Have) ‚úÖ
1. **Authentication with domain restriction** ‚úÖ
2. **Firestore security rules** ‚úÖ
3. **Core database structure** ‚úÖ
4. **Security rules deployment** ‚úÖ
5. **Local development environment** ‚úÖ

### High Priority (Should Have) üöß
1. **Cloud Functions deployment** (blocked by permissions)
2. **Contact form with email notifications** (function ready)
3. **File upload system** (rules ready)
4. **Admin role management** (rules ready)

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have) ‚è≥
1. **Real-time analytics dashboard**
2. **Advanced file management**
3. **Bulk operations**
4. **Performance monitoring**

## üìä Current Status Summary
