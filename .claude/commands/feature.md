# Create Feature Branch

Create new feature branch following project conventions:

1. Switch to current sprint branch (e.g., sprint/sprint-01)
2. Pull latest changes from origin
3. Create feature branch: `feature/PU-X-description`
4. Push new branch to origin
5. Set upstream tracking
6. Update Jira ticket status to In Progress

Follow strict branch strategy - always branch from sprint, not main.
