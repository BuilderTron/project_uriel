Comprehensive context recall and project state analysis:

1. Check current git branch and recent commits
2. Review git status for uncommitted changes  
3. Read current todos to see active tasks
4. Check ROADMAP.md for sprint progress and current focus
5. Review relevant MEMORY.md files for recent patterns/decisions
6. Look for PU-X ticket number in branch name or recent commits
7. If Jira ticket found:
   - Get ticket details and current status
   - Review description, acceptance criteria, and comments
8. Analyze recent file changes to understand work progress
9. Identify where development left off and blockers
10. Summarize current context, next steps, and any decisions made
